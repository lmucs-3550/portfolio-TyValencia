Here is my portfolio for LMU Spring 2023: CMSI3550 - Networks and Internets!

I had a lot to do this semester but I'm glad I took this course and it was definitely one of the highlights. I use the internet all the time but was a bit thwarted by its complexity, however, this class did a good job breaking it down into digestible bits. I had a lot of fun exploring different network problems, especially in my how-to-fix-your-internet and final-project assignments. There were still some things I would have liked to expand on, such as documenting more with the network explorations, but I felt I learned a lot in this class. Ideally, I would have liked to be at a higher level of coding so that I could have done more implementation rather than research, but I'm still glad I was able to research the topics I found interesting. Coming out of the class, I feel somewhat comfortable trying to implement Python projects like the ones in class. I will be taking that, along with my knowledge from my final project, into the summer, and trying to implement AI programs using the ChatGPT API myself.&#x20;
